## üìä Project Portfolio

### **Level 1: Data Wrangling & Exploratory Analysis**

| Project | Title | Description | Key Skills |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Web Scraping & Data Collection** | Python-based Jumia Egypt web scraper. Extracts product details (name, SKU, URL, ratings) and customer reviews from multiple pages. Handles pagination and uses throttling for ethical collection, saving structured data to CSV. | `Python` `BeautifulSoup` `Pandas` `Requests` |
| 2 | **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** | Transformed raw retail sales data into an analysis-ready asset. Handled missing values (KNN imputation), removed outliers, and encoded categorical features. Output curated datasets for EDA and ML. | `Pandas` `Scikit-learn` `Data Cleaning` `KNN Imputation` |
| 3 | **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** | Analyzed supermarket sales data to uncover key trends. Found the Consumer segment and Technology category drive most revenue, with strong holiday peaks. Insights guide marketing and inventory strategies. | `Pandas` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn` `Data Visualization` |

### **Level 2: Core Machine Learning**

| Project | Title | Description | Key Skills & Models |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Predictive Modeling (Regression)** | A machine learning project that predicts house prices using property features. Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluated multiple regression models. | `Linear Regression` `Decision Trees` `Random Forest` `Feature Engineering` |
| 2 | **Classification** | Classifying iris flowers into three species. Compared model performance through accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. **SVM achieved 96.7% accuracy.** | `Logistic Regression` `Random Forest` `SVM` `Model Evaluation` |
| 3 | **Clustering** | Applied unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering) to segment customers based on their characteristics. Goal: enable targeted marketing and improve customer retention. | `K-Means Clustering` `Unsupervised Learning` `Customer Segmentation` |

### **Level 3: Advanced Applications & AI**

| Project | Title | Description | Key Skills & Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Time Series Analysis (TSA)** | Developed ARIMA and SARIMA models to forecast YUM stock closing prices. Analyzed historical data, identified trends/seasonality for informed financial decision-making. | `ARIMA` `SARIMA` `Statsmodels` `Time Series Forecasting` |
| 2 | **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** | NLP project for sentiment analysis and spam detection. Transforms labels into a binary classification task. Includes preprocessing, EDA, and an ML pipeline with TF-IDF. | `NLP` `TF-IDF` `Sentiment Analysis` `Spam Detection` |
| 3 | **Neural Networks (NN)** | A deep learning project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the MNIST dataset, achieving **~98% accuracy** with TensorFlow/Keras and hyperparameter tuning. | `TensorFlow` `Keras` `CNN` `Deep Learning` |
